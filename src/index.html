            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I'm the Founder & CEO of Brink AI Labs, where I'm building the Context & Memory OS for AI-native applications—technology that gives software the ability to perceive users in real time, understand their intent, and act with human-like agency. My focus is on enabling the next generation of agentic systems: ones that don't just respond, but anticipate.</p>
            <p>Before Brink, I spent nearly a decade leading engineering and data organizations at Disney+ Hotstar, JioCinema (Viacom18), and Swiggy, operating at the scale of hundreds of millions of users. At Hotstar and JioCinema, I led Data Platform, Personalization, and large parts of the Core Engineering organization, building systems that supported some of the world's largest live events—including streaming infrastructure that scaled to 50M+ concurrent viewers during global sports tournaments. My work spanned data platforms, ML systems, playback and CDN optimization, recommendations, quality of experience, and large distributed architectures.</p>
            <p>Across these roles, I built and managed high-performing engineering teams and worked at the intersection of data, personalization, consumer behavior, and large-scale distributed systems. Those experiences shaped my belief that real-time understanding—not just data collection—is the foundation for the next frontier of AI.</p>
            <p>I studied at BITS Pilani, where I received a dual degree in Electronics & Instrumentation and Chemistry. Outside of work, I enjoy long runs, cooking healthy food, building small experimental tools, and exploring the intersection of human behavior and intelligent systems.</p>
